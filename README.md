# A joint Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and subgenomic RNA viral dynamics and seroconversion

Here are some example R code and JAGS code for the model implementation in "A joint Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and subgenomic RNA viral dynamics and seroconversion" by Dong and Brown (2022). 

1. *joint_vl_sero_r.R*: R code for fitting the joint Bayesian model. 

2. *joint_vl_sero_jags.txt*: JAGS code for fitting the joint Bayesian model. 

3. *model_par_diag_primary.pdf*: Full model diagnostic report for the primary model fitted to the COVID-19 PEP study data, as described in Section 4.1 of the main manuscript and Section S1.3 of the Supplement.
